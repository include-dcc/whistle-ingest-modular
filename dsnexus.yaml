study_title: "Nexus Translational Biobank"
study_desc: "The Nexus is a patient registry, clinical database, and biological sample bank focused on developmental disorders. Its major goal is to advance research by (i) linking human cognitive, behavioral, neurological and other clinical phenotypes to biological samples, including DNA, plasma, and lymphoblastoid cell lines, and (ii) facilitating access to appropriate patient cohorts for research purposes. The Nexus is unique among biorepositories in that it combines extensive clinical data and biosamples, and emphasizes the inclusion of quantitative cognitive and behavioral data."
