# Whistle Ingest Modular
This repository is intended as the first step toward a fully automated whistle ingest for INCLUDE. The input for this project is harmonized data or study/dataset content. The output is FHIR resources which can be loaded into a FHIR server.

This project is different from whistle-ingest-linkml in that the project will, eventually, allow the same configurations to be used to ETL Study or Dataset or Harmonized Data based on the run arguments. We will also be supporting projection versioning once the pipeline used supports it.
